#ECG Arrhythmia Classification using 1D-CNN (ResNet)

This project detects and classifies ECG arrhythmias using a custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network with Residual Blocks (ResNet). It was built using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset and achieves an accuracy of 98.51%.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
Preprocessing with adaptive filtering, Shannon Energy, and Hilbert Transform

R-peak detection and heartbeat segmentation

1D-CNN with 3 residual blocks (ResNet-style)

Classification into 5 arrhythmia classes: N, S, V, F, Q (AAMI standard)

Achieved 98.51% accuracy with strong F1-scores
